 dynamicpricingEngine
ChatGPT said:  A machinelearning–driven dynamic pricing engine that unifies transactions, product, and calendar data to recommend SKUlevel price bands, competitor parity actions, seasonal promo timing, and stockaware pricing strategies.

Perfect ✅ — let’s expand Version 1 into a consultingstyle deep dive while keeping the same structure. This way, your README (or portfolio writeup) feels professional, detailed, and selfcontained.



 Dynamic Pricing Engine — Version 1 (Full Case Study)



 1. Problem & Relevance

Business problem:
Retailers and ecommerce players struggle with setting the right price. If the price is too high, sales volume drops. If too low, margins erode. The complexity grows because category managers must also factor in:

 Competitor pricing → are we overpriced/underpriced in the market?
 Seasonality → some categories peak in specific months (e.g., beverages in summer, electronics during holidays).
 Promotions → discounts can lift sales, but overpromotion destroys profit.
 Inventory position → stockouts mean lost revenue; overstocks mean carrying costs.

Why it matters:
For large retailers, a 1–2% improvement in margin or stock efficiency can mean tens of millions in profit annually.

Where it’s relevant:

 Supermarkets and CPG (FMCG)
 Ecommerce platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, eBay)
 Electronics and Apparel retailers
 Pharmacies and OTC healthcare

This project builds a Dynamic Pricing Engine that combines machine learning with business rules to generate actionable insights at the SKU level.



 2. Dataset

We use three datasets that simulate a retail environment:

 Transactions (219k rows)

   Columns: date, product\code, category, brand, unit\cost, selling\price, competitor\price, promotion\flag, units\sold, stock\on\hand
   Purpose: capture historical demand, promotions, and competitor behavior.

 Products (200 SKUs)

   Columns: product\code, category, brand, unit\cost, list\price, price\elasticity, baseline\daily\demand
   Purpose: product master data + elasticity priors.

 Calendar (1,096 days)

   Columns: date, day\of\week, month, year, is\weekend, holiday, season
   Purpose: seasonality, holidays, and weekend effects.

These are merged into a unified table (`pricingdf`) — the analytical base for modeling and insights.



 3. Approach (EndtoEnd)

1. Data Cleaning & Profiling

    Nulls, dtypes, duplicates checked.
    Reusable cleaning function built for consistency.

2. Feature Engineering (businessaligned)

    Pricing metrics: margin, margin%, price\gap.
    Demand dynamics: lag features (1, 7 days), moving averages (7, 28 days).
    Product priors: elasticity, baseline demand.
    Calendar: weekend, holiday, seasonality.
    Inventory: stock\on\hand, reorder point (ROP), reorder quantity (ROQ).

3. Target Variable

    `unitssold` → clipped to reduce outlier impact.

4. EDA

    Scatterplots: price vs. demand (elasticity curves).
    Barplots: demand by category, promotion impact.
    Correlations: pricing vs. units\sold.



 4. Models Trained

| Model             | RMSE | R²    | Key Takeaway                               |
|  |  |  |  |
| Linear Regression | 3.78 | 0.601 | Interpretable baseline                     |
| Ridge Regression  | 3.78 | 0.601 | Handles multicollinearity, no uplift       |
| Lasso Regression  | 3.78 | 0.601 | Sparse features, similar to baseline       |
| Random Forest     | 3.70 | 0.617 | Captures nonlinearity, interpretable      |
| XGBoost           | 3.66 | 0.627 | Best gradient boosting baseline            |
| LightGBM      | 3.64 | 0.630 | Selected model: best accuracy + robust |



 5. Key Drivers of Demand (consistently across models)

 Baseline daily demand → strongest predictor of expected sales.
 Promotion flag → major lift factor (20–70% depending on category).
 Margin % → higher prices hurt volume sharply (negative driver).
 Moving averages (ma\7, ma\28) → recent demand momentum matters.
 Stock on hand → high stock correlates with higher sales (availability bias).
 Season & Calendar → beverages peak in Summer; electronics peak in holidays/weekends.



 6. Solution Delivered

The SKU Insight Engine produces multiple businessready reports:

1. Price Bands (floor, target, ceiling)

    Guardrails based on historical price ranges + margin floor.
    Defensible bands for pricing managers to operate within.

2. Competitor Parity Report

    Competitor price, parity gap %, risk band (Low/Med/High).
    Recommended move: nudge up / nudge down / hold steady.

3. Seasonality Report

    Seasonal uplift factors (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).
    Weekend/holiday lift factors.
    Best promo window highlighted.

4. Stock Health Report

    Days of cover (DoC).
    Reorder point (ROP) and reorder quantity (ROQ).
    Posture: protect, steady, accelerate.

5. Watchlists

    `watchlistrepricing.csv`: SKUs needing price adjustment.
    `replenishmentlist.csv`: SKUs to reorder urgently.
    `seasonalpush.csv`: SKUs to promote in upcoming peak season.

6. Narrative SKU Reports (Markdown)

    Problemwise insights for each SKU: Pricing Issues, Competition, Seasonality, Stock Health.
    Each block includes Facts & Recommended Actions.
    Example:

     ```
     Pricing Issues
       • Target band: $21–$28 (target $24)
       • Current price: $29 → outside guardrails
       • Price posture: accelerate (→ floor)
     Actions:
        Lean toward floor price
        Run clearance promo due to overstock
     ```



 7. Why Reports Are Useful

 Category Managers: Clear operating bands, parity risks, and price postures → actionable rules.
 Inventory Planners: Stock health reports with reorder points/quantities → prevents stockouts and overstock.
 Marketing Teams: Promo timing reports (best season, weekend/holiday lifts) → maximize ROI.
 Executives: Summaries highlight % SKUs overpriced/underpriced, % overstocked, seasonal opportunities.

This transforms raw data into operational dashboards & cheat sheets that teams can actually use.


 8. End Insights

 Promotions and baseline demand dominate; pricing needs to be adaptive, not static.
 Overpricing beyond parity bands sharply reduces volume → parity monitoring is essential.
 Seasonality drives demand windows (e.g., +32% Summer lift for beverages).
 Inventory posture must guide pricing:

   Low stock → protect margin, avoid promos.
   Overstock → accelerate with promos, lean to floor price.



 9. Business Suggestions

1. Enforce Operating Guardrails

    Keep SKU prices within floor–ceiling bands and aligned with competitor parity.

2. Promo Strategy by Seasonality

    Allocate promotional budgets to peak seasons & weekends/holidays.

3. StockDriven Pricing

    Dynamic link between stock position and pricing posture (protect vs. accelerate).

4. CategorySpecific Parity Rules

    Commodities like snacks: tighter parity (±3%).
    Differentiated products like electronics: wider parity tolerance (±8%).

5. Governance

    Weekly generation of watchlists.
    Monitor realized KPIs (margin uplift, sellthrough rates).

 10. Future Scope (Version 2+)

 Hyperparameter tuning + uplift simulation → refine accuracy and scenario planning.
 Elasticity estimation per SKU → build price–demand curves.
 A/B test integration → validate pricing recommendations.
 Streamlit dashboard → interactive, managerfriendly UI.
 Automated competitor feeds (APIs/scrapers) → live parity checks.
 Confidence scoring → prioritize recommendations based on data stability.
 
Version 1 is a complete endtoend solution:
From raw retail data → features → models → SKUlevel actionable insights → business recommendations.
